Documentation, everyone reads it nobody writes it, is that true? 

# A little bit about me

I’m Sara Sánchez Ortiz, a Technical, UX, and programmer writer living between two amazing cities Madrid and Alicante, Spain. I write and explore tech for a living and I am also a Technical Translator.

I know enough coding to be dangerous and a lot of grammar to be pikcy. I love the Oxford comma, em dashes, semicolons, and the interrobang. My grammar is descriptive when writing and prescriptive when editing. I break rules all the time if it helps getting a message across.

I help people and companies through documentation and coding. I can help you to make your code understandable by humans and not only developers ;) and of course making any kind of guidance that could be useful for real people to trhive into your code. 

## What do I need documentation?

Great question! and I'm sure you are thinking documentation is not needed. But if you're here maybe you have though twice about it and maybe you have been struggling sometimes with something you don0t understand and blaming the person who writes it because it is so difficult to inderstand. So that's why you need a good documentation.  You can make your customers happy, with a well written and easy documentation.

### It is really something I need

If you are continuing reading, then yes. You needed it. Let me explain you something. Having a good documentation may avoid you:

## C'mon I can do that

Sure! you can do that! And I'm sure that you will also be able to do a lot of things, but you'll need training and I am already have it ;) So I can help you with creating, copywriting, revieweng your documentation and make it accesible and easier for everyone. C'mon let's have a call so I can explain to you the great things words can do.



The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
